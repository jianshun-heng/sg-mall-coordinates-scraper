# SG Mall Coordinates Scraper
In this repository, I have re-built a code that was written 4-years prior (see CREDIT below) to scrape the list of all malls in Singapore and obtain their corresponding coordinates.
I have also generated an updated 2023 mall_coordinates.csv output file if anyone is interested

# Built With:
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - The software used to write and run the code
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Language that code was written in
* [One Map API](https://docs.onemap.sg/) - Used to generate coordinates
